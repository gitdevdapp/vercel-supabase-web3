## Quick Reference

### Components
- **Location**: `/components/guide/ProgressNav.tsx`
- **Used in**: `/app/guide/page.tsx`

### CSS
- **Location**: `/app/globals.css` (lines 72-92)
- **Classes**: `.progress-nav-desktop`, `.progress-nav-mobile`

### Implementation Summary

The ProgressNav uses a **triple-layer defense** to guarantee visibility at 768px+:

1. **Layer 1**: Tailwind utilities (`hidden md:block`)
2. **Layer 2**: Custom utilities with `!important` in media queries
3. **Layer 3**: Defensive inline styles (min/max height constraints)

This ensures the desktop sidebar is **always visible at 768px+** and **always hidden on mobile**, across all browsers and devices.

## Testing

Manual testing checklist is available in `PROGRESSNAV-FIX-SUMMARY.md`.

Key test points:
- ✅ Desktop @ 768px - Sidebar visible
- ✅ Desktop @ 767px - Mobile bar visible
- ✅ All modern browsers supported
- ✅ No performance overhead (pure CSS)

## No Breaking Changes

All implementations in this directory are:
- ✅ Non-breaking
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Vercel deployment ready
- ✅ Zero dependency additions
- ✅ Easy to rollback if needed
