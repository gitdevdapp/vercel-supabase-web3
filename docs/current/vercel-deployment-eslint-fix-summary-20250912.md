# Vercel Deployment ESLint Error Resolution Summary
*Date: September 12, 2025*

## Session Overview

This session involved diagnosing and resolving a critical Vercel deployment failure caused by an ESLint error in the recently implemented backed-by section. The issue was successfully identified, fixed, and comprehensive prevention measures were added to the deployment guide.

## Initial Problem Statement

The user reported a Vercel deployment failure with the following error:

```
Failed to compile.
./components/backed-by-section.tsx
1:21  Error: 'accelerators' is defined but never used.  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
info  - Need to disable some ESLint rules? Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#disabling-rules
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

## Context Analysis

### Recent Implementation History
The error occurred after a comprehensive backed-by section implementation that included:

- **New Components Created:**
  - `components/backed-by-section.tsx`: Main section component
  - `components/investor-logo.tsx`: Individual logo component
  - `lib/investors.ts`: Data management layer

- **Integration Changes:**
  - Updated `app/page.tsx` to use the new BackedBySection
  - Text corrections throughout the codebase ("Web3 dApps" → "dApps")
  - Asset additions (8 investor logos)

- **Deployment Success:** The implementation was successfully deployed to production via Vercel

## Root Cause Diagnosis

### Code Analysis
After examining `components/backed-by-section.tsx`, the issue was traced to line 1:

```typescript
import { investors, accelerators } from "@/lib/investors";
```

**Root Cause:** During the backed-by section implementation, the `accelerators` import was added to the component but never actually used. The component displays static accelerator information directly in JSX rather than mapping over the `accelerators` data array.

### Why This Occurred
- The `lib/investors.ts` file was designed to export both `investors` and `accelerators` arrays
- During implementation, the component initially imported both for potential use
- The final implementation chose to display accelerator information statically rather than dynamically
- The unused import was not caught during the initial implementation and deployment

## Fix Implementation

### Code Change Applied
**File:** `components/backed-by-section.tsx`

**Before (causing error):**
```typescript
import { investors, accelerators } from "@/lib/investors";
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
import { investors } from "@/lib/investors";
```

### Verification Process
1. **Local Testing:** Installed Node.js environment (nvm + Node v24.8.0)
2. **Dependency Installation:** Ran `npm install` successfully
3. **Build Verification:** Executed `npm run build` - completed successfully
4. **Static Analysis:** Build process confirmed no ESLint errors

### Build Results
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 3.9s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (17/17)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```
