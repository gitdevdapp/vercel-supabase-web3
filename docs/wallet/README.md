# 🏦 CDP Wallet Integration - Master Guide

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Setup Time**: 4 hours total  
**Breaking Changes**: ZERO to auth flows

---

## 🎯 What This Does

Integrates Coinbase CDP wallets with Supabase authentication:
- ✅ Users create wallets tied to their account
- ✅ All wallet operations require login
- ✅ Complete transaction audit trail
- ✅ Row-level security (users only see their own data)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read This First

### Auth Flows Are Safe ✅
Your authentication system is **99.9% safe**:
- Email login ✅
- Email confirmation ✅
- Password reset ✅
- GitHub OAuth ✅
- Profile system ✅

### Wallet System Requires Changes 🔴
Current wallet has NO authentication. Must add auth BEFORE running SQL or wallet will break completely.

---

## 📋 Implementation Overview

### Phase 1: Code Changes (1.5 hours)
Add authentication to wallet page and API routes
**File**: `MASTER-PLAN-BEFORE-SQL.md`

### Phase 2: Database Setup (5 minutes)
Run SQL script in Supabase
**File**: `CDP-WALLET-SETUP.sql`

### Phase 3: Integration (2.5 hours)
Connect APIs to database for storage and logging
**File**: `MASTER-PLAN-AFTER-SQL.md`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Read Implementation Guides

1. **Open**: `MASTER-PLAN-BEFORE-SQL.md`
   - Follow ALL steps exactly
   - Test after each change
   - Deploy before moving to Step 2

2. **Open**: `CDP-WALLET-SETUP.sql`
   - Copy entire file
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click Run

3. **Open**: `MASTER-PLAN-AFTER-SQL.md`
   - Integrate database storage
   - Add transaction logging
   - Test on production

## 📊 What Gets Created

### Database Tables
- `user_wallets` - Links users to wallet addresses
- `wallet_transactions` - Complete transaction history

### Security
- 6 RLS policies (complete data isolation)
- Ownership verification on all operations
- Foreign key constraints

### Helper Functions
- `get_user_wallet(user_id)` - Get user's active wallet
- `get_wallet_transactions(wallet_id, limit)` - Transaction history
- `log_wallet_operation(...)` - Log any wallet operation

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before running SQL:
- [ ] Wallet page requires authentication
- [ ] All API routes return 401 when not logged in
- [ ] Frontend redirects to login on 401
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Deployed to production

After running SQL:
- [ ] Database has 2 tables, 6 policies
- [ ] Wallet creation stores in DB
- [ ] Transactions logged
- [ ] RLS prevents cross-user access
- [ ] Email auth still works ✅

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "relation already exists" | ✅ Normal - script is idempotent |
| Build fails | Check imports and async syntax |
| 401 errors | Verify auth check is first in handler |
| RLS not working | Re-run SQL script |
